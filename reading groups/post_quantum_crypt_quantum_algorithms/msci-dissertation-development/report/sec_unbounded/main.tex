Our discussion starts with an investigation into {\emph{unbounded operators}}. These differ from our previous notion of a bounded operator, as they are defined on subspaces of the Hilbert space that underlies them. After an introduction to unbounded operators, we look at the graph of an operator, which give a lot of insight into unbounded operators. We then look at some important classes of operators and how to identify these classes; namely, we look at the {\emph{closed}}, {\emph{symmetric}}, {\emph{self-adjoint}}, and {\emph{essentially self-adjoint operators}}.

\medskip

Due to our time constraits, about half of the proofs to our results are forced into the appendix, Section \eqref{appendix:supplementary_chapter}. We encourage the reader to engage with this proofs as they are vital to getting a grasp on how unbounded operators behave. A brief refresher to Lebesgue integration in $\R^n$ and the theory of bounded operators is given in the appendix, Section \eqref{appendix:background_chapter}, or in the books {\cite{stein}} and {\cite{muscat}}.

% We start our discussion by investigating the properties of {\emph{unbounded operators}}. We first look at what precisely we mean by an unbounded operator. We then take a quick aside to talk about graphs of operators, which are a useful tool in our discourse and help motivate our definition. We then define what precisely we mean by the adjoint of an unbounded operator, as these are slightly more technical to define than in the bounded case. We finally look at some main classes of unbounded operators, namely the closed, symmetric, self-adjoint, and essentially self-adjoint operators, and we see some shortcuts on determining if an operator belongs to these classes.

% The theory of unbounded operators is very rich, and combines ideas from analysis, topology, and algebra. Due to our time constraints, we will avoid discussions of the topological aspects of this theory. The prerequisites from the analysis side are also unfortunately quite high, and involves the reader having been exposed to abstract measure theory and the theory of bounded operators. A very brief overview of abstract measure theory and bounded operators has been included in Appendix \eqref{appendix:background_chapter}, and the non-specialist reader is encouraged to refer to this appendix throughout our work. Fluency in metric spaces is vital to all our work, and we recommend {\cite[Chapters 1 - 6]{muscat}} for a relevant background. We also note that {\cite[Chapters 7-10, 14, 15]{muscat}} contains the background needed for bounded operators on Hilbert spaces.

Throughout our work, we will let $\HS$ refer to a complex Hilbert space, which we normally take to be separable. We adopt the convention of our inner products, denoted by $\ip{\cdot, \cdot}$, to be linear in the first variable. For some subset $A \subset B$, we use the notation of $\overline{A}$ to refer to the closure of $A$, which is in terms of the metric induced by the norm of $\HS$. The set $\N$ refers to the strictly positive integers, and the set $\N_0$ refers to the non-negative integers.
