The purpose of this section is to introduce the non-specialised reader the main ideas from measure theory and operatory theory needed as a background for our work. This is, by far, not a substitute for a first course to these topics, and there is not enough time to do them justice. A lot of simple or long details are ommited due to our time constraints, and the non-specialised reader is encouraged to go to the referenced sources for the details.

\subsection{An overview of Hilbert spaces and bounded operators}
In this section, we recap some important assumed knowledge on Hilbert spaces and bounded operators. As this is assumed knowledge, most of the proofs are omitted with reference. We then introduce the concepts of compact operators, normal operators, and the spectrum operator, before proving the major result of the spectral theorem for compact normal operators.
